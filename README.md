# Image-Gallery

The initial project was part of the Zero to Mastery Course on Udemy and used a series of statically chosen images from Pexels. This updated version uses javascript to pull a series of images at random from Unsplash while preserving the image gallery responsive design from the initial project.

In addition, clicking on an image will load the larger version of it that's available from Unsplash.

This project can be seen live at: https://newbury-image-gallery.netlify.com/
