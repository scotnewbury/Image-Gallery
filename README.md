# Image-Gallery

Image gallery based off project in the Zero to Mastery course

The initial project used a series of statically chosen images from Pexels. This updated version uses javascript to pull a series of images at random from Unsplash while preserving the image gallery responsive design from the initial project.

In addition, clicking on an image will load the larger version of it that's available from Unsplash.
